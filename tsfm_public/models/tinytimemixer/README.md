### Examples for multivariate evaluation datasets
The multivariate evaluation datasets utilized in these scripts are `etth1, etth2, ettm1, ettm2, weather, electricity, traffic`.
The datasets should be stored in a directory `datasets/` in the follwing structure for the function `get_data` to work.  

- ETT datasets: "datasets/ETT-small/ETT*.csv"
- Weather dataset: "datasets/weather/weather.csv"
- Electricity dataset: "datasets/electricity/electricity.csv"
- Traffic dataset: "datasets/traffic/traffic.csv"

The datasets can be downloaded from the Informer model's repository https://github.com/zhouhaoyi/Informer2020.
