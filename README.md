# TSFM: Time Series Foundation Models
Public notebooks and utilities for working with Time Series Foundation Models (TSFM)

The core TSFM time series models have been made available on Hugging Face -- details can be found 
[here](wiki.md).


# Python Version
The current Python versions supported are 3.9 and 3.10.

## Initial Setup
First clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:IBM/tsfm.git
cd tsfm
```

## ðŸ“• Notebooks Installation
Several notebooks are provided in the `notebooks` folder. They allow you to perform pre-training and finetuning on the models.
To install use `pip`:

```bash
pip install ".[notebooks]"
```

## ðŸ’» Demos Installation
The demo presented at NeurIPS 2023 is available in `tsfmhfdemos`. This demo requires you to have pre-trained and finetuned models in place (we plan to release these at later date). To install the requirements use `pip`:

```bash
pip install ".[demos]"
```

# Notice

The intention of this repository is to make it easier to use and demonstrate IBM Research TSFM components that have been made available in the [Hugging Face transformers library](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/index). As we continue to develop these capabilities we will update the code here.
